A **backplane** in the context of **SignalR** refers to an intermediary system used to coordinate message delivery between different **SignalR server instances** in a distributed, load-balanced environment.

When you have a real-time application (like your campaign management dashboard) using SignalR, clients are connected to different server instances, especially when scaling across multiple servers. Without a backplane, **server instances wouldn’t be able to share messages** with clients connected to other servers, which is where the backplane comes in. It acts as a **message relay** that ensures real-time messages are broadcast across all servers, so that every client, regardless of which server they are connected to, can receive the same real-time updates.

### Why Do You Need a Backplane?

In a **single-server** environment, SignalR can manage communication between clients connected to the server directly. However, in a **multi-server** setup (used to handle more traffic), the following problems arise:

- Clients are distributed across multiple servers.
- A message sent by one server won't automatically reach clients connected to another server.

For example:

- **Server A** has Client 1 connected.
- **Server B** has Client 2 connected.

If you send a message from Server A, only Client 1 will receive it. Without a backplane, Client 2 (connected to Server B) won’t know about the message. A **backplane** ensures that the message sent from Server A is propagated to Server B, so Client 2 also receives it.
