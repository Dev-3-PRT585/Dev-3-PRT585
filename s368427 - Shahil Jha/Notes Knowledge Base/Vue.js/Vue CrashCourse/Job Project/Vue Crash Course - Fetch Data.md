Now we need to fetch the data from the JSON server. I will be using the `Axios` library, but you can just as well use the Fetch API to do this. We will be using the `onMounted` lifecycle hook to fetch the data when the component is mounted.

First, let's install Axios:

```
npm install axios
```

Your script should look like this:

```
<script setup>
import JobListing from '@/components/JobListing.vue';
import { RouterLink } from 'vue-router';
import axios from 'axios';

import { ref, defineProps, onMounted } from 'vue';

const props = defineProps({
  limit: Number,
});

const jobs = ref([]);

onMounted(async () => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('http://localhost:5000/jobs');
    jobs.value = response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching jobs:', error);
  }
});
</script>
```

So on mount, we are fetching the data from the JSON server and setting it to the `jobs` ref. If there is an error, we are logging it to the console.

Now you should see the job listings again but now they are coming from the server. This is more realistic than just storing them in a file.
