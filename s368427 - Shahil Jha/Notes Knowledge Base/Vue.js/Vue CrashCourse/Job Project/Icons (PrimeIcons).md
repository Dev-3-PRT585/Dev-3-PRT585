We are going to be using some icons in our project. There are many icon libraries. The one that we'll be using is called `PrimeIcons`. Let's install it:

```
npm install primeicons
```

Now replace the following:

```
<i className='fa-solid fa-location-dot text-lg'></i>
```

with the following:

```
<i class='pi pi-map-marker text-orange-700'></i>
```

You should now see the map marker icon. You can view all the available icons here - [https://primevue.org/icons/](https://primevue.org/icons/)
