Let's start by defining what Vue is. Vue.js is a **progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces and single-page applications**. It’s designed to be simple, flexible and incrementally adoptable, meaning you can start using it for small parts of your application and gradually scale up. Vue makes it easy for developers to integrate it into projects of all sizes, whether you’re just adding some interactivity to an existing webpage or building a complex web application from scratch. With its reactive data binding and component-based architecture, Vue.js helps developers create dynamic and interactive experiences for users in a straightforward and efficient way.

Vue.js was created by Evan You in 2013. Evan is an independent developer who is currently based in Singapore. At least, that's what I know from his bio. I think the fact that Vue.js wasn't created by a Google or Facebook and is still as popular as it is, speaks volumes about the framework.
