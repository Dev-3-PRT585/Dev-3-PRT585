Let's clean all of this up so that we have an clean slate to work with. Replace all of the code in the `App.vue` file with the following:

```
<template>
  <h1 class="text-2xl">Vue Jobs</h1>
</template>
```

I added a Tailwind class, but we have not setup Tailwind yet, so it will not do anything.

There is a folder called `components`. Let's delete everything in there. We will be creating our own components.
