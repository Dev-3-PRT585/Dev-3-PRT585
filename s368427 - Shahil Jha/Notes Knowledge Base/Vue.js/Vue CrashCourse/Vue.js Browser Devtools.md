I would suggest installing the Vue devtools for your browser. They are available for Chrome and Firefox. I'm not sure about other browsers because I haven't used another browser in over a decade. This will allow you to inspect your Vue components and see the data, props, and state of your components. It's a very useful tool.

You can download and install from the following urls:

- [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd?hl=en)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vue-js-devtools/)

Once you install, you should have an option for "Vue" in your devtools. From there, you can click on the components and see props, state, etc.
