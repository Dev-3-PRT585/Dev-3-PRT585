So why Vue over something like React or Angular?

- **Simplicity & Approachability** - Vue.js is renowned for its simplicity and ease of integration into existing projects. It has a very gentile learning curve and it makes it accessible to developers with varying levels of experience, allowing them to quickly get started and become productive.
- **Flexibility** - Vue.js is designed to be incrementally adoptable, meaning you can introduce it into your project gradually. Whether you need to build a small widget or a full-fledged single-page application (SPA), Vue.js scales effortlessly to meet diverse project requirements. You can also build server-side rendered and static websites with Vue meta frameworks.
- **Performance & Size** - Vue.js offers excellent performance due to its efficient rendering mechanisms, including the virtual DOM. Additionally, Vue's core library is lightweight, which contributes to faster initial load times and better runtime performance. It is known to be one of the fastest frontend frameworks.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Like other modern frameworks, Vue.js promotes a component-based architecture. Components are self-contained units that can be reused across different parts of your application, fostering maintainability and code reusability.
- **Active Community and Ecosystem**: Vue.js has a really vibrant community and a rich ecosystem of libraries, tools, and plugins. In addition to building single page applications (SPA), you also have meta frameworks like Nuxt.js, which allows you to use server-side rendering (SSR) as well as frameworks like Gridsome, which allows you to build static websites. So Vue has a great ecosystem that is similar to the ecosystem of React.

Choosing Vue.js over React or Angular often boils down to personal preference. You should also take into account what's being used in the industry, especially in your area, but I'm also of the opinion that you should enjoy the framework that you're working with. My advice is always to try the frameworks that interest you. That's why I create these crash courses, so you can get your feet wet and create something and see which one really clicks with you. That's also why I like to create the same app with multiple frameworks. it really gives you a sense of how each framework works.
