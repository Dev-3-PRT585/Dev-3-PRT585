People always ask me "when am I ready to learn a framework?" The answer to that is a tough one because everyone has a different learning abililty and different ways that they learn. I know people that learned JavaScript at the same time as they learned React or Vue. However, I definitely don't think that's optimal for most people. I think you should first HTML, CSS and then the fundamentals of JavaScript. And I don't just mean learn what a variable and a function is. I mean learn to the point where you can build some kind of frontend project without any kind of framework.

I usually recommend the following:

- JS Fundamentals - Loops, functions, objects, etc.
- Events, DOM Manipulation, etc.
- Fetch API & Basic HTTP.
- Arrow functions, high order array methods, destructuring, etc.

I have a course at traversymedia.com and on Udemy called **Modern JavaScript From The Beginning**. It provides everything you need to know and more about JavaScript. So if you want to check that out, I'll have a link in the description.

I would also suggest knowing about NPM (Node Package Manager) because you'll be using this a lot to install 3rd party packages as well as setting up the tools to generate Vue.js projects such as **create-vue**.
