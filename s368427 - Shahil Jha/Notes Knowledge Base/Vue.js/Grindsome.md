## Gridsome in Vue.js

- **Overview**:
  - Gridsome is a static site generator built on top of Vue.js. It is designed to create modern, fast, and SEO-friendly websites that can be easily deployed as static files.

- **Key Features**:
  - **[[Static Site Generation(SSG)]]**: Converts Vue components into static HTML files during the build process, ensuring fast load times and improved [[SEO]].
  - **GraphQL Integration**: Allows querying data from various sources, including Markdown files, APIs, CMSs, and databases, using GraphQL.
  - **Vue.js Ecosystem**: Fully leverages the Vue.js ecosystem, allowing the use of Vue components, Vue Router, and other Vue plugins.
  - **Automatic Code Splitting**: Automatically splits code for each page, ensuring minimal JavaScript is loaded initially for faster page loads.
  - **Markdown Support**: Built-in support for writing content in Markdown, making it easy to manage content within the site.

- **Architecture**:
  - Gridsome builds a GraphQL layer from your data sources, allowing you to query data within your Vue components. It then generates static HTML files for each route defined in the application.
  - The generated site is served as static files, which can be hosted on any static file hosting service.

- **Benefits**:
  - **Performance**: The pre-rendered static files are lightweight and can be delivered to users quickly, even on slow networks.
